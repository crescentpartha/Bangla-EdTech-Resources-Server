## `Description`

> <p align="justify"><b><i>Bangla-EdTech-Resources</b></i> is an EdTech, Bangla documentation-type, and technological skills-based platform. It is a web-based application that will improve the traditional system of education. There are so many EdTech Platforms that provide only video lessons. But we know that documentation is more important than any other method in the technical field. <br />On the other hand, Some EdTech platforms provide their lessons in English medium.
